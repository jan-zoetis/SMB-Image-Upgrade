libpng12.so.0 copied from 12.04: to /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpng12.so.0


dpkg --purge nodm


Added systemd scripts


To make the root file system read-writable the method described in the document 
describing the 12.04 image is for some reason not working on 18.04

# mount -o remount,rw /mnt/root-ro
# touch /mnt/root-ro/disable-root-ro
# reboot

The following must be added before reboot

# cp /mnt/root-ro/etc/fstab.rw /mnt/root-ro/etc/fstab 

And vice versa when going back

# rm /disable-root-ro
# cp /etc/fstab.ro /etc/fstab
