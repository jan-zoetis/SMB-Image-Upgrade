Base Image Generation:

The base image was created by sourcing script.bash and running selected functions manually as follows:

Grub stuff:

For reasons (so far) unknown the installation of grub performed by script.bash (install_bootloader)
(accessing the partitions via loop devices) does not work when the script is run on 18.04.

Grub was successfully installed with grub-install directly on the partition on the generated CF card
using the command below (after the generated image was copied to the CF car using dd) and the 
card mounted.

grub-install --compress=gz --target=i386-pc --debug 
             --grub-mkdevicemap=/media/hellem03/88d67b2d-08eb-4406-bff5-2b932da0fa4e/grub/device.map 
             --boot-directory=/media/hellem03/88d67b2d-08eb-4406-bff5-2b932da0fa4e  (/boot???)
             /dev/sdb



List of modifications made directly on the running image:

X11 stuff:

On the 12.04 the Galaxy touch screen is configured via /home/smb/xorg.conf and calibrated
using xinput-calibrator that generates a configuration section that is added to xorg.conf.

This does not work on 18.04. A "driver" package for the touch screen (eGTouch_v2.5.7413.L-x.zip)
must be installed. (http://www.eeti.com/drivers_Linux.html). 

This installation contains:

    eGTouchD (the driver daemon)
    eGTouchU 
    eCalib   (calibration tool)

The 12.04 image uses the minimal display manager "nodm" that is designed for running an application
in kiosk mode. This setup has been simplified to run without nodm, but just run the X server and the
kiosk application.

    dpkg --purge nodm

The following apt packages was needed:

    libasound2 (needed by eGTouch calibration tool)
    linux-modules-extra-5.0.0-23-generic (needed to get i915 graphics driver supporting xrandr screen rotation)
    dbus-x11


libpng12.so.0 copied from 12.04: to /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpng12.so.0


Using X configuration from /etc/X11/xorg.conf (default)

Added systemd scripts (in /lib/systemd/system):

    xserver.service               Starts X
    egtouch.service               Starts the eGTouchD daemon
    kiosk-application.service     starts the SMB application as user smb

Added SMB application (Application) start script

    /home/smb/start-application.sh



To make the root file system read-writable the method described in the document 
describing the 12.04 image is for some reason not working on 18.04

# mount -o remount,rw /mnt/root-ro
# touch /mnt/root-ro/disable-root-ro
# reboot

The following must be added before reboot

# cp /mnt/root-ro/etc/fstab.rw /mnt/root-ro/etc/fstab 

And vice versa when going back

# rm /disable-root-ro
# cp /etc/fstab.ro /etc/fstab

Added scripts and fstabs for this:

    /home/smb/go-ro.sh
    /home/smb/go-rw.sh

    /etc/fstab.ro
    /etc/fstab.rw
